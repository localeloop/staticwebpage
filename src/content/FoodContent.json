  "text": "We get told repeatedly we have the best burgers, all-day breakfast & Sunday roast in town but why don’t you decide for yourself. Not to mention our huge veggie/vegan offering which has made us a Vegan destination of Surrey. But it doesn’t stop there. We are a British pub after all so you will be delighted by our pub classics such as fish & chips, steaks, sandwiches, pasta & salads. We love developing our recipes, keeping it fresh and making food from scratch so be sure to check out our ever-changing specials and highly anticipated burger of the month when you next visit. Food is available from 10am until 9:30pm everyday!",
  "flip": "Did you know most of our menu is Vegan or can be made Vegan? With some of the owners being  Vegans themselves and ridiculously passionate about food our Vegan offering is not just an afterthought that Vegan’s have come to settle for in hospitality. We strive to create the most DELICIOUS Vegan food possible with as much choice as possible. That’s why we are a Vegan destination of Surrey, and proud of it!"
